      Blondin bids farewell to home crowd with Mass Start gold
    </h1>

    <p class="date">24 Nov 2025</p>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
       Ivanie Blondin (CAN) gave the crowd value for money on the final day of her final ISU World Cup in Calgary. The 35-year-old Canadian pushed teammates Isabelle Weidemann and Valérie Maltais to a silver medal in the Team Pursuit, and won gold after a powerful sprint in the Mass Start.  
      </p>

      <p>
       Femke Kok (NED) led an unprecedented one-to-five Dutch sweep in the 500m, with Angel Daleman (NED) breaking the Junior World Record in fifth place.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        Emotional Mass Start gold for Blondin
      </p>

      <p>
        When Blondin finally got off the ice on Sunday — after skating five distances on the weekend, including three on the final day — she had two words: “Pretty incredible.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Part of the reason was the fans.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The crowd was insane,” Blondin said. “My parents were here. I had my sponsor, here as well. It’s most likely my last World Cup here, so I’m a little bit emotional. It hasn’t really hit yet. Maybe once I have a beer, I’ll probably get a little bit more emotional.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The Mass Start was Blondin’s highlight on Sunday. After a fast race, she managed to perfectly manoeuvre into position for the final sprint, and none of the other skaters were able to keep up with her on the straight. Marijke Groenewoud (NED) finished second and last week’s winner, Mia Manganello Kilburg (USA), took third.


      </p>

      <p>
        “It's great,” said Blondin, who plans to retire at the end of the season. “It’s what I wanted after last week. It was a weird finish to the Mass Start. My goal was to keep it together, not to let any breaks happen, because my forte is obviously the final sprint. I found a hole in the last lap, went for it on the inside. Glad I held that corner, because I entered it really tight to not impede on Val (teammate Valérie Maltais), because she was obviously in the race lane. I had a little bit of a stumble, but I was able to hold.” 
      </p>

      <p>
“It ends better than it started,” said Groenewoud, who finished 14th in the 3000m on Friday and second in the 1500m B Division on Saturday. “My 3000m was not good, yesterday I sort of got it back, and today it was fine.”      </p>

      <p>
      The sprint could even have gone better, she acknowledged. 
      </p>

      <p>
“I had myself locked in a bit by the Chinese in front of me (Hou Jundan). I wanted to go on the inside and she thought the same. Therefore, I went into the final corner a bit too sharp, and I hit the ice with my boot, which made me swerve outside. Blondin took the shortest route and then you’re at the line quicker.”      </p>

      <p>
Kilburg retained first place in the World Cup standings, and she was over the moon with her second podium finish this season.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That means I got it locked in,” she said. “For US speed skating, it’s two podium finishes in the first four World Cups to qualify for the Olympic Games, so I’m going to Milan.”
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
      Dutch train back on track
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Mass Start, Groenewoud pushed the Orange train back on track after Elisa Dul (NED) lost connection in last week’s World Cup, when the Dutch finished fifth.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Joy Beune leading, Antoinette Rijpma-de Jong in the middle position and Groenewoud at the back, the Netherlands got back to their successful World Championships lineup. Skating as a unit, they stopped the clock at two minutes and 52.52 seconds.
