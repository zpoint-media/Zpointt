          From the host nation Morocco to emerging football nations such as Cape Verde and Equatorial Guinea, storylines across the continent are building excitement ahead of kick-off.
        </p>

        <p>
          Morocco, buoyed by their 2022 World Cup semi-final heroics, enter the tournament as favorites. With stars playing across Europe and a passionate home crowd behind them, the Atlas Lions are expected to contend for their first AFCON title since 1976.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nigeria also arrives with high expectations, boasting one of the most talented attacking lines in Africa, backed by players competing in the Premier League, Serie A, and La Liga. Their strength in depth makes them a dangerous opponent for any team.
        </p>

        <p>
          Senegal, the defending champions, hope to retain their crown. Led by a core of experienced players, they remain tactically disciplined and physically dominant — a formula that has brought them sustained success.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, Egypt, the most successful nation in AFCON history, aims to reclaim glory with Mohamed Salah leading the charge. Their tradition and experience make them perennial contenders.
