          Spain delivered one of the greatest performances in modern European basketball history at the FIBA EuroBasket 2026 final in Belgrade. In front of a sold-out arena, the Spanish squad defeated Serbia 89–82, securing their first EuroBasket title since 2022 and marking a dramatic return to the top of European basketball.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rising star Alejandro Martín led Spain with 27 points, while veterans Lorenzo Brown and Willy Hernangómez provided crucial leadership in the final minutes. Serbia, backed by an electrifying home crowd, pushed the game to its limits with stellar performances from Nikola Jokić and Vasilije Micić.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          A final for the ages
        </p>

        <p>
          The atmosphere inside Belgrade Arena was unmatched as both teams traded baskets throughout the first half. Spain’s speed and ball movement became the difference in the third quarter, allowing them to build a lead they never gave away.
        </p>

        <p>
          “This is a dream,” Martín said after the match. “To win against Serbia in Serbia — unbelievable. We believed in ourselves from day one.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Spain’s bench played a major role, outscoring Serbia’s reserves 22–11, a contribution that proved decisive in the closing minutes.

          Serbia fought back strongly in the fourth quarter, reducing Spain’s 12-point lead to just three with under two minutes remaining. Jokić’s dominance inside the paint kept Serbia alive, but Spain’s clutch perimeter shooting, especially from Brown, closed the game out.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We gave everything,” Jokić said. “Spain deserved the win today. Their energy and precision were exceptional from start to finish.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Spain’s defense, anchored by Usman Garuba, forced Serbia into three late turnovers that tipped the momentum permanently in Spain’s favour.

        <p>
          The victory marks a new era for Spanish basketball, with young talents stepping up on the international stage. Martín, who was crowned Tournament MVP, averaged 22.4 points per game — the highest scoring average in EuroBasket since 2003.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We’re building something special,” Spain coach Sergio Scariolo said. “This group has heart, talent, and a future. EuroBasket 2026 is only the beginning.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, Serbia remains a powerhouse despite the loss. Analysts expect them to remain favourites heading into the FIBA World Cup 2027 qualifiers.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Looking ahead
        </p>

        <p>
          Spain now shifts attention to the 2027 World Cup cycle, with hopes of defending their global ranking. With Martín, Garuba, Brown, and Hernangómez forming a strong core, their prospects look brighter than ever.
