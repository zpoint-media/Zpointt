          Team Spain delivered a stunning performance to claim the United Cup 2026 title in Sydney, defeating the defending champions Italy in a dramatic final. 
          The Spanish squad, led by world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz and WTA rising star Paula Badosa, showed balance, teamwork, and determination throughout the tournament.
        </p>

        <p>
          The final opened with a confident win from Badosa in the women’s singles, defeating Italy’s Martina Trevisan in straight sets. That early lead boosted Spain’s momentum going into the men’s singles.
        </p>

          Alcaraz seals the victory
        </p>

        <p>
          Carlos Alcaraz stepped onto the Ken Rosewall Arena with enormous pressure, but the 22-year-old Spaniard delivered one of his best matches of the season. He defeated Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti 6–3, 6–4, securing Spain a 2–0 lead before the mixed doubles.
        </p>

        <p>
          “This means a lot,” Alcaraz said. “To play for Spain, to start the season like this, and to win the United Cup with my teammates — it’s unbelievable. The energy in the stadium was incredible.”

          In the mixed doubles, Spain paired Alcaraz and Badosa against Italy’s Berrettini and Trevisan. The Italians fought fiercely to extend the tie, pushing the match to a super tiebreak, but Spain held their nerves to close out the win 10–8.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We trusted each other,” Badosa said. “The United Cup is special because men and women get to play together. This title belongs to our whole team, not just the players on court.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The Italian side remained proud of their run. “Spain were simply stronger today,” Berrettini said. “But reaching the final again shows our growth as a team.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Team captains praised the squad’s unity, describing it as one of Spain’s best team efforts in recent years.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Everyone contributed — even the players on the bench,” said Team Captain Anabel Medina. “This is the kind of win that builds confidence heading into the 2026 season.”
        </p>

        <p>
          With their victory, Spain becomes the third nation to lift the United Cup trophy, joining the USA and Italy in the competition’s young but growing history.
