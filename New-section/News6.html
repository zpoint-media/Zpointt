      </h1>

          Valencia Basket delivered one of the most stunning performances of the season after defeating tournament favorites Virtus Bologna in a high-intensity EuroCup clash. The Spanish side overcame a slow start and used a late fourth-quarter surge to seal a 92–87 victory in front of a roaring home crowd.
        </p>

        <p>
          American guard Jared Harper led the scoring with 27 points, while Semi Ojeleye dominated the boards for Valencia, helping the team complete a remarkable comeback that keeps their EuroCup campaign alive.

          High emotions as Valencia turns the game around
        </p>

        <p>
          The atmosphere erupted inside La Fonteta as Valencia overturned an early 12-point deficit. The fans were instrumental, pushing the team with every possession. 
        </p>

        <p>
          “The crowd was unbelievable tonight,” Harper said after the win. “We needed every bit of their energy. This victory means a lot for our confidence going forward.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Head coach Álex Mumbrú praised the team’s composure: “Bologna is one of the strongest teams in the competition. To come back the way we did shows character, discipline, and belief.”

          The turning point came midway through the fourth quarter when Valencia went on a 14–2 scoring run. Harper and Ojeleye combined for several clutch plays, while Chris Jones contributed vital assists to keep the offense flowing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Virtus Bologna, led by Daniel Hackett and Tornike Shengelia, struggled to retain momentum in the final minutes. Despite a late push, they were unable to break Valencia’s defensive wall.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We made too many mistakes down the stretch,” Hackett admitted. “Against a team like Valencia, you pay for that. We will regroup and come back stronger.”
        </p>

          Valencia’s comeback was not without tense moments. A potential game-tying three from Bologna in the final 20 seconds clattered off the rim, allowing Valencia to secure the win with free throws. 
        </p>

        <p>
          “We kept our focus,” Ojeleye said. “Even when they pressured us, we stuck to the game plan. That’s what made the difference.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The result means Valencia moves into the top positions of their group, strengthening their push towards the EuroCup playoffs.

          Eyes now on the knockout stages
        </p>

        <p>
          With Valencia regaining form and Bologna looking to bounce back, the EuroCup continues to build excitement. Both teams remain strong contenders, but this result adds another layer of unpredictability to the 2026 season.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fans across Europe will now look ahead to upcoming decisive fixtures as the race for the EuroCup title intensifies.
